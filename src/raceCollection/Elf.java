While meditating, you can dream after a fashion, such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefits that a human does after 8 hours of sleep.";

Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.";
